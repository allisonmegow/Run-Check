# Run-Check for Mac!
Run lots of data causing your program to run a long time? What if you didn't have to check your Mac? The future is now; this workflow sends you a text when the run is done. 
NOTE
This is my first github share! I'm new to bioinformatics and coding and whatever else this is. I'm using the terms I know, so if they aren't clear, let me know!
This was made for Tahoe, unsure if it will run on other OS. It's free to try!


# How to Use
1. Ideally, if you are running a program, you have used tmux or nohup to allow it to run in the background. If you haven't, and you aren't long into a run, do it now!!!! Additionally, it is important that you prevent your computer from sleeping. You can do this by using caffeinate or altering your settings, but note that this only works if youre plugged into a charger (I've tried to override, no luck). Your program will stop if your computer is asleep! (You don't run in your sleep, do you?)

2. Download the [ZIP](https://github.com/allisonmegow/Run-Check/blob/7f5c88fea51649f5538b2479762685395ce96088/runcheckerforthepeople02.zip). This Read me covers the readme.txt in the file, as I prepared it for my friends.

3. Click on the shortcut. Add to shortcuts. Open shortcuts, and edit the shell to your needs. You will need to imput the specific program that you are using. I made this for orthofinder. You will also need to type in your phone number.

4. Click on the .workflow file. Open the workflow in Automator. Again, edit the pause time and loop time as needed.

5. Click Play and let 'er rip!

6. Enjoy!
